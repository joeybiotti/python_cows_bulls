# Python Cows and Bulls.

Yes, its another python console app, but this one's a game! When the app starts, the user is asked to guess a number. A random number is generated and the user's input is compared. If the user guesses the correct number, they get a "cow", every wrong answer gets a "bull". 

As of the latest commit, the program doesn't _quite_ run, but it just requires some tinkering. I'll get it to work.
