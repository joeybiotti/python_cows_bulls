# Python Cows and Bulls.

Yes, its another python console app, but this one's a game! When the app starts, the user is asked to guess a number. A random number is generated and the user's input is compared. If the user guesses the correct number, they get a "cow", every wrong answer gets a "bull". 

To clarify:

The user is asked to enter a number when the console says: `Guess a number`. If the user guesses 1234, and the random number generated is 1984, the user gets two cows and two bulls. Makes sense, right?
